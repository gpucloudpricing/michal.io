## Forward Mode Auto Diff

Compute derivatives in the forward pass

### Cons
- need to do partials for each input variable separately (full forward)



## Reverse Mode Auto Diff

Compute in reverse topological order





## Dynamic vs Static Graph

Dynamic builds computation graph on each iteration
