# Convolutional Neural Networks




## Contrastive Pretraining for CNNs

- [GitHub - keyu-tian/SparK: [ICLR'23 Spotlight] The first successful BERT-style pretraining on any *convolutional network*; Pytorch impl. of "Designing BERT for Convolutional Networks: Sparse and Hierarchical Masked Modeling"](https://github.com/keyu-tian/SparK)

## Fast Training
- [GitHub - tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10: Train to 94% on CIFAR-10 in less than 10 seconds on a single A100, the current world record. Or ~95.77% in ~188 seconds.](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10)
- [GitHub - KellerJordan/cifar10-airbench: 94% on CIFAR-10 in 2.73 seconds ðŸ’¨ 96% in 27 seconds](https://github.com/KellerJordan/cifar10-airbench)
