### Transducers - RNN-T

Separate source encoder for input sequence and "predictor" model that only predicts next token in output space (LLM), with a "Joiner" module that takes the encoder and predictor outputs and combines them to predict the next output.

- [ ] good for streaming
- [ ] + can pretrain the predictor in self supervised fashion on next token prediction
